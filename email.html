<h1>Hi everyone!</h1>
<p>
  You might know me, you might not. For those who don't, hi, I'm Parsa. I'm a senior.
  <br>
  <br>
  I hope you have had a great first day of school. If you're new at ASM, welcome. If you are returning, doesn't the school look great?
  Anyways, let me get onto the real reason that I am e-mailing you all.
  <br>
  <br>
  Whether you are new here or not, I think we can all agree that the scheduling system is confusing. Don't get me wrong, it works!
  But while very efficient, it's not really made for humans.
  <br>
  <br>
  Here's where I come in. Over the summer, I have spent some time building a Web App (which some might have used a version of last year) that
  takes your classes and generates a calendar out of them so you can see what you have the next day without having to know whether it's an A-Day, B-Day or any other day.
  All you do to see what classes you have is to open up a calendar client (such as Google Calendar) and check your classes. Sounds good? Good.
</p>
<h1>Okay, how do I get it?</h1>
<p>Just click the button below and you will be redirected to my website â€“ it might take a tiny bit to load, sorry. From there just follow the instructions and you should be good.</p>
<button style="background: #EF5350; color: #f3f3f3; font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; width: 200px; height: 50px; border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 10px;"><a href="https://calendar.parsuli.net" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">Go To App</a></button>
<h1>Seniors</h1>
<p>Hey guys. You know the DP Flex thing some of you find very confusing. Well, lucky for you, this app also takes care of that. Just make sure to check the <i>Senior</i> toggle before inputting your classes. Also, make sure you press that HL toggle so I know which classes you'll be flexing on. ;)</p>
<h1>Teachers</h1>
<p>
  You might be wondering why I e-mailed you. You already have something like this, no? Well, this is different...Okay. I actually don't know if it's different. It might be, but I'm not sure exactly what it is you are given. If it's a Google Calendar, then this is pretty much the same. Otherwise, this one is an actual calendar.
  <br>
  Actually, I came up with something. What if there is a snow day? Then your calendar will be shifted by 1 or more days. I take that into account. I can take care of that.
  <br>
  If you're sold, the app is out there and it works for teachers too. All you have to do is, if you teach a senior class, select <i>Senior</i> so you can choose the HL classes you teach and have DP Flex roll over for you as well. If you choose not to use it. No worries.
</p>
<h1>A few notes</h1>
<p>Yea, I'm done. I'm just gonna give some non essential information here.</p>
  1. This is my CAS project. Just wanted to mention that.
  <br>
  <br>
  2. This app will need Google access but you can read what it uses and why in the Privacy section of the website. Basically, it's needed to create an account for you.
  <br>
  <br>
  3. If for some reason you don't know what to do, just e-mail me. I'm glad to help.
  <br>
  <br>
  4. If you add your Google Calendar to your iPhone, you can use Siri to tell you tomorrow's classes.
  <br>
  <br>
  5. As mentioned, your calendar is saved under an account. This means, if you change your schedule, you just login again and write the new classes. No need to re-add your calendar. All changes will appear in a day.
  <br>
  <br>
  6. Thank you for bearing with me. I hope I made your life easier.
